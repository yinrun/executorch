# MUSA AOTI model acceptance

`aoti_model_acceptance.py` validates the complete MUSA path for twelve models:

- `mlp`: Linear + ReLU + Linear + ReLU;
- `simple_cnn`: Conv2d + ReLU + MaxPool2d + Conv2d + Flatten + Linear;
- `simple_video_cnn`: Conv3d + ReLU + MaxPool3d + Conv3d + pooling + Linear;
- `simple_decoder`: ConvTranspose2d + ReLU + ConvTranspose2d with output padding;
- `transformer_block`: torchvision-independent TransformerEncoderLayer;
- `causal_attention`: causal grouped-query attention with Q/K/V projections;
- `embedding_classifier`: int64 token IDs, Embedding, pooling, and Linear;
- `token_encoder`: int64 token IDs, Embedding, TransformerEncoderLayer, and Linear;
- `token_decoder`: int64 token IDs, Embedding, causal GQA, LayerNorm, and vocabulary projection;
- `narrow_resnet18`: ResNet-18 block topology with narrow channels and a 32x32 input;
- `resnet18`: unmodified torchvision ResNet18 with random weights and a 64x64 input;
- `mobilenet_v2`: torchvision MobileNetV2 with depthwise convolutions and a 64x64 input.

The script writes the PTE, external AOTI data, raw input, expected output, and
runner output to the selected directory. It compares the `executor_runner`
output with the MUSA eager result; no CPU execution is used as a correctness
baseline.

Floating inputs and weights default to FP32. `--dtype fp16` or `--dtype bf16` exercises
the same export and runner path in lower precision. The default absolute and
relative comparison tolerances are 1e-4 (FP32), 1e-2 (FP16), and 4e-2 (BF16);
token models always accept raw int64 input IDs and `--dtype` selects the
weights and output dtype. For `token_decoder`, the script also checks exact
argmax token IDs against MUSA eager.
override them with `--atol` and `--rtol` if needed. `--input-size 224` exports
ResNet or MobileNet with a 224x224 input instead of its default size. Fixed
spatial shapes and dtypes require separate exports.
`--batch-size 2` exports and checks a separate fixed-shape, two-input batch
(the default batch size is one).

`--batch-size 2 --dynamic-batch-max 4` instead exports one PTE with a bounded
dynamic batch dimension and checks batch sizes 2, 1, and 4 against MUSA eager.
The script pads raw input files to the bound and passes the actual shape via
`executor_runner --input_shapes`; that runner otherwise interprets the raw
buffer as a bound-sized tensor. Other dynamic dimensions are not covered.
For torchvision models, `--weights /path/to/state_dict.pth` loads a
local PyTorch state dictionary (for example, a cached pretrained checkpoint)
before exporting. Without it, the model uses random weights; the script never
downloads weights automatically.

The MUSA backend disables TorchInductor's layout optimization so Conv1d/2d/3d
fallback outputs and generated kernels agree on contiguous NCHW layout. The
eager reference disables muDNN TF32 to match the fallback's FP32 FMA math.
The native fallback supports non-transposed Conv1d/2d/3d and ConvTranspose2d
with output padding smaller than its stride; other transposed dimensions are
not yet supported.
MUSA AOTI decomposes inference-only SDPA into matmul, softmax, and masking to
avoid an unavailable TorchMUSA AOTI fallback. Pattern matching is disabled
only while compiling graphs containing SDPA, as it otherwise fuses those ops
back into the unavailable fallback. Dropout is unsupported. The current
TorchMUSA export specializes attention batch dimensions, so bounded dynamic
batch acceptance is not yet available for models containing attention.
Boolean/additive masks, causal attention, and GQA are covered separately;
combining a causal flag with a custom mask is not supported.
All-masked rows are not covered: math SDPA can yield NaNs, while TorchMUSA's
low-precision flash attention can behave differently.

## Prerequisites

To validate official pretrained ResNet18 weights, download
`https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet18-f37072fd.pth` separately and pass
the local checkpoint with `--weights`. Its SHA-256 is
`f37072fd47e89c5e827621c5baffa7500819f7896bbacec160b1a16c560e07ec`.
This checks inference against MUSA eager using a random input, not ImageNet
accuracy or performance.
MobileNetV2 IMAGENET1K_V2 weights are available at
`https://download.pytorch.org/models/mobilenet_v2-7ebf99e0.pth` (SHA-256
`7ebf99e03e254b273379b23edca7ec0da9f48273b23a332b93c1c99d49e86e8f`).

On M1000 with torch-musa 2.9.0.post1+musa5.1.2mp22, the following exports
passed `executor_runner` versus MUSA eager (maximum absolute output error):

| Model | Input | Dtype | Weights | Max error |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| MLP | 1x16 | FP16 / BF16 | Random | 4.88e-4 / 3.91e-3 |
| Simple CNN | 1x3x32x32 | FP16 / BF16 | Random | 2.44e-4 / 1.95e-3 |
| Simple 3D CNN | 1x1x4x8x8 | FP32 | Random | 7.45e-9 |
| Simple decoder | 1x3x8x8 | FP32 | Random | 5.96e-8 |
| TransformerEncoderLayer | 1x4x16 | FP32 / FP16 / BF16 | Random | 4.77e-7 / 1.95e-3 / 7.81e-3 |
| Causal GQA | 1x4x16 | FP32 / FP16 / BF16 | Random | 1.19e-7 / 1.22e-4 / 3.91e-3 |
| Token encoder | 1x4 int64 | FP32 / FP16 / BF16 | Random | 5.96e-8 / 4.89e-4 / 1.96e-3 |
| Token decoder | 1x4 int64 | FP32 / FP16 / BF16 | Random | 1.79e-7 / 4.89e-4 / 3.91e-3 |
| ResNet18 | 1x3x224x224 | FP32 / FP16 | Official pretrained | 6.05e-6 / 3.91e-3 |
| ResNet18 | 1x3x64x64 | BF16 | Official pretrained | 0 |
| MobileNetV2 | 1x3x224x224 | FP32 | Official pretrained | 2.03e-6 |
| MobileNetV2 | 1x3x64x64 | FP16 | Official pretrained | 1.37e-2 (`--atol 0.02`) |
| ResNet18 | 2x3x64x64 | FP32 | Official pretrained | 3.34e-5 |
| MobileNetV2 | 2x3x64x64 | FP32 | Official pretrained | 1.76e-5 |

With a single dynamic-batch PTE for each model, batches 2/1/4 of FP32 MLP
passed (maximum error 4.47e-8). Batches 2/1/3 also passed for FP32 simple CNN
(3.58e-7), pretrained ResNet18 (3.53e-5), and pretrained MobileNetV2
(1.76e-5); both pretrained models used 64x64 inputs.
For the simple 3D CNN, batches 2/1/3 passed with a single PTE in both FP16
(maximum error 6.11e-5) and BF16 (4.89e-4).
For the simple decoder, batches 2/1/3 passed with a single PTE in both FP16
and BF16 (maximum error 0 for this test input).
The embedding classifier also passed batches 2/1/3 in FP32 with one PTE
(maximum error 1.20e-7), confirming dynamic int64 inputs without attention.
The token decoder matched eager token IDs `[4, 13, 56, 44]` in all three
precisions. It is a fixed-sequence toy model, not a pretrained LLM or a
KV-cache/incremental decoding validation.

These are random-input correctness checks, not arbitrary shape-generalization
or throughput measurements. Pretrained MobileNetV2 BF16 at 64x64 does not yet
meet the default tolerance: the maximum difference is 0.140625 and 121/1000
logits differ beyond `--atol 0.02 --rtol 0.04`. Do not count this configuration
as verified until the precision difference is understood. In isolated prefix
exports, the first two feature blocks match bit-for-bit. The next block's
pointwise Conv2d also matches, but its following BatchNorm differs at 4 of
98,304 BF16 values (maximum 0.03125); the discrepancy grows through later
blocks. Investigate BF16 BatchNorm rounding before relaxing the tolerance.

Without `--runner`, the script only exports the PTE/PTD and writes the eager
reference files. The runner command automatically adds the MUSA, Torch, and
Python shared-library directories used by the current environment.
